No. It's part of the Web platform API 
The various objects that implement the Fetch API are "host objects". i.e. objects exposed to user and JavaScript that are provided by the application hosting the runtime.
They only define the language (syntax and semantics) and a few builtin objects. You can implement a compliant JS engine it without providing fetch.

The Fetch standard is part of the web platform, underlying several other web standards. It states that it "also defines the fetch() JavaScript API" - and it's just that, and API for the JavaScript language.
example: navigator, ajax, fetch, etc.,
